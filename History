## My experience with creating a popular game for the first time, the struggles I've had mentally and my plans for the future.

Anyone who knows me knows I like to waffle my thoughts, and normally I make some long crazy announcement about it on discord, but today I'm following Tal's route of uploading the waffle in a github thing. No idea how to use this but here we go.

Before TRS, I can find Roblox football game attempts of mine dating back to 2017/18 - all of them never really took off, but I was adamant to create something that everyone could enjoy. I still haven't achieved that at least not the standard I would've liked to but anyway, here's the story of how TRS was created.

In May 2022 I came up with an idea to create a pitch for leagues to use, and that being the sole purpose of the game. I approached Tal and Soulshyper (who went on to make MMP) and they both agreed to work on what was then MPS Match Pitch with me. Back then I'd met SoulsHyper through a group chat with some old friends, and Tal I ironically met as a TPS moderator because he was an exploiter at the time, and as much as he made my life painful by creating and releasing exploit scripts, I saw the potential in him to use his knowledge for something more than selling the odd script for barely any Robux. I approached them both to create what is now known as TRS.

The game started off as a just a pitch with a set of admin commands, and what it grew into I could never of imagined in a million years. I've been on Roblox since I was 10, at the same TRS was made I was 20. I spent a good 5-7 years (From around 2015-2017 onwards) creating really low effort projects and not understanding what I was doing in them, so I expected nothing more from TRS to begin with. But then I realised that people were starting to join, more and more people, without ever putting anything into advertising. 

In the early days there's a few people who were paramount to TRS's success, I would like to go into further detail about them.

**Seby (hzroto)**
I met Seby probably a year or two before TRS, in a TPS server - and I have considered Seby one of my closest friends ever since. He joined TRS and he was an absolute legend, he supported me, tested the game, gave feedback, and eventually he done tool work and to this day still edits tools. He's honestly a legend.

**Burnaldo**
I met Burnaldo while playing TPS also, he has a very popular shot in the game named after him that he created, and we met during a game once. Like Seby, he is one of the pillars of TRS and without them I would've lost motivation a long time ago. They always picked me up when I was down and I owe them a lot.

**Tayfun**
This is going to sound crazy but Tayfun genuinely have like V0.0005 place file of TRS, he helped me a lot when I was figuring out collision issues with the game and was always supportive, I know he's going to hate me giving him credit for this - but he played a huge part in me not giving up early on.

**Denny**
Denny no longer plays Roblox but his YouTube videos on TRS early doors really really grew the game. His videos got thousands of views and have even been on our game page as he made trailers. We still talk often and I plan to meet up with him a second time real soon.

Anyway back to the story,
